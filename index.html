        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My life is very fast and busy. I barely have time to relax. I have many important people in my life that helped shape me into the person I am today. I have my family, my friends, and even other people who have influenced me and they do not even know it. There are also special events that have happened throughout my lifetime that shaped me by the outcome. <br> The first key people in my life are my parents. My parents are the best parents out there. They are kind, caring, and compassionate, while also guiding me to make smart decisions on my own. They have helped me by showing me what is right and what is wrong. I think this is the most important lesson they have taught me.</p>
